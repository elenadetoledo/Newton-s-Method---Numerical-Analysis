We were asked to write a program to implement the Newton-Raphson method in order to find the zeros of the gradien of the Himelblau's function for a given starting 
point in the rectangle [-6,6],[-6,6].

We made a contour-plot of the function together with a visual explanation of the regions from where there will be convergence to each of the minima, and the regions 
from where there will be any other situation.

For this purpose, we used a grid search.
